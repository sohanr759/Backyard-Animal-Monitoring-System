# Backyard-Animal-Monitoring-System
BAMS is an implementation of computer vision which uses a pre-trained machine learning model called MobileNetV2 for image detection.
It also uses Twilio, a cloud communications service provider which allows the user to be notified about the animal that was identified by the model through SMS.
The model has been deployed on TensorFlow with Keras.
